# 3D-Printing-Web-Interface
This is my first repository on GitHub...

This project is about extending 3D printing access to users who don't know how to utilize CAD software. The code in this repository is a web interface that allows users to create a simple 2D graph concept (with different types of joints, varying link lengths) that will eventually be converted into the STL file necessary for printing any 3D object.
